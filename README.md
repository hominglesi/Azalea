# Azalea
A lightweight 2D game framework. 

### Where to get it
All versions prior to 1.3 are hosted on this github page, but the latest versions are all hosted on the [nuget page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azalea).

### Motive
This framework was created because I didn't like the already existing options and also wanted to learn more about all the little things that make an engine work. To create the first working version I took a lot of inspiration from [osu-framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework) so the structure of Azalea is really similar to it. Since then many more unique systems have been added to solve various common needs of game development.  

### Usage
You are free to use this Framework for non-commercial purposes, although the current documentation lacks many important guides for common functions. This will be addressed in the future, but for now you can message me directly for questions.
